committed
=========

Automatically commit files on change.

Basically I made this to track my todo files. Should work cross-platform, but I haven't tested it on *nix yet.
At present it watches an entire directory for changes and commits changes after 500ms of inactivity.

Probably doesn't work for subdirectories. I'll fix that soonish.
Going to update this so you can track specific files and exclude files using the config.
